In the folders, there are the following : 
- 1 Excel for datafile , 1 pbix (powerBI file) for each individual learning skillset per folder
- an additional word document is added for final project, going through my thought process and precedure as to cleaning the data , seeing the relationship and ultimately,  making the visualization using PowerBI

This project/guide teaches me the basic uses of PowerBI:
- How to visualize data
- Familarity with the software (how to use it)
- Presenting data properly (visually appealing and easy to understand)
